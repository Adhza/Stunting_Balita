# Stunting_Balita

**Make machine learning models that will be implemented into a website.**

This project was carried out to conduct research on the features that influence toddler stunting in children. later from these features a machine learning model will be created using the supervised learning method, namely random forest.

In this project contains the steps in making a machine learning model, which are as follows:
1. Import Data
2. Preprocessing Data
- data typer changes
- drop unused data
- scaling data
3. perform data splitting with several trials (70:30, 60:40, 80:20)
4. Making a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier using train data that is determined based on splitting data
5. Evaluate data using a confusion matrix
6. perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameter values ​​automatically using the grid search
